# Track 2 – Team Recommendation Implementation
# What would be implemented in 1–2 sentences?

For the referral problems, the company would implement an easy-to-use referral system that simplifies both the referral and acceptance process for customers. A tiered incentive structure and targeted promotions, such as offering account credit for the first successful referral, would be introduced to encourage inactive customers to begin referring and to motivate ongoing participation.

# What is the success metric and baseline? What metric should not get worse?

Our baseline churn rate is 26.5%, and the goal is to reduce customer churn by increasing customers’ referral counts. At the same time, one important metric that I do not want to get worse is the referral incentive cost. This is because the cost of referral incentives should not exceed the benefits gained from new customers and those who are referred by existing customers.

# How would you measure impact and what are two risks or unintended consequences?

Measurement:
An A/B test can be conducted by requiring a portion of participants to take part in the experiment, such as providing them with coupons and discounts to observe the effectiveness of our method. On the other hand, no incentives would be given to another group of participants in order to observe the outcome without incentives. Finally, we would compare the outcomes of the two groups.
Unintended consequences:
Due to the implementation of financial incentives, the company may experience increased promotional costs, and these costs could potentially exceed the benefits gained from the program.
