\## Individual Contribution

  

\### What did you personally contribute to the most?

I personally contributed to building the Logistic Model and conducting LASSO analysis. Through LASSO, I obtained the AUC score and curve. Then, I compared the AUC scores with other models completed by my group members. Moreover, after we decided to use the XGBoost model, since the XGBoost model had the best AUC score, I identified the key variables from the model and divided these factors into risk factors and loyalty factors.

  

\### What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?

One approach I strongly advocated for was using multiple models to compare performance rather than relying on a single model. By analyzing and comparing logistic regression, LASSO, random forest, and XGBoost, we were able to validate our findings and ensure our results were accurate. This approach helped our team identify the most reliable predictors of churn and provided strong support for our final recommendations.

  

\### Lessons Learned and Future Improvements

One key lesson I learned from this case competition is the importance of translating technical findings into clear business insights and recommendations. Coding can be written easily, but insights and recommendations are very important when presenting results to others. If we only show graphs and statistical results, customers and companies may not be able to fully understand them.
