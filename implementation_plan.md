What does this repo do in plain language?

They did the regression for the model and had the scatter plot. And they can use the regression model to know the significance of the model, and we can know the p value is less than 0.05, therefore, the model is significant. Before our model study, we used the python to run the model. I tried to learn to use R to run the model.

o What would you need to change to use it for a real company?

To use this for a real company, I would need to replace the sample dataset with real company data, such as sales data or customer behavior data. In addition, the model could be expanded to include more variables and improve prediction accuracy. The analysis process could also be automated so that the company can regularly update the results and support data-driven decision making.
